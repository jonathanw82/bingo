# Disco Bingo

Disco Bingo, a game created by myself for a laugh with my work collegues.

It's a bingo game with a twist. Unlike normal bingo, disco bingo has a dystopian overlord voice, a character based on the Red Queen from the movie franchise Resident Eval.

Her sole purpose is to get participants to recreate 70s disco dance moves that can be seen in the video but with modern music. The compare then issues a prize to the best dancer at the end of the game. 
The bingo side is like any usual game with line, house and 4 corner games.

### How to run the game!
The compare logs into the dashboard, using the password Letmein. Shortly after a video starts and a voice introduces herself and explains how the game works. You will then be redirected to the main dashboard where the Bingo engine can be found. After the dance button is pressed a video will pop up with dance moves and music, press the close button at the bottom of the screen when the video ends.

After all 5 dance videos have been played and all bingo games are played the compare can then press the end credit button where a video will start and a voice will close the games and a video with credits will show. This is the end of the game simply logout for the next user. 

### The login screen 
The login screen consists of a login box where a user name can be entered. If an incorrect user name is entered a button called Not You? can be pressed to refresh the page.
After entering the user name a password box will appear, if the correct password is entered you will then be redirected to the starting video.

## Bingo Engine
The bingo engine has multiple features including autoplay where the engine will generate a new number once a timer has elapsed, the speed of this timer can be set via a dropdown called game speed.
Once a number has been generated it is added to the called number board on the left-hand side of the screen. This is for reference when a caller shouts for a win.
Hitting the space bar at any time will pause the game and stop the auto number generation.
