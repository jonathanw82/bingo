# Disco Bingo

Disco Bingo, a game created by Jon Wheway, is based on Ostara by LettUs Grow.

It's a bingo game with a twist. Unlike normal bingo, disco bingo has a dystopian overlord called Dark Ostara, a character based on the Red Queen from the movie franchise Resident Eval.

Her sole purpose is to get participants to recreate 70s disco dance moves but with modern music. The compare then issues a prize to the best dancer at the end of the game. 
The bingo side is like any usual game with line, house and 4 corner games.

### How to run the game!
The compare logs into the dashboard, using the correct credentials. Shortly after a video starts and Dark Ostara introduces herself and explains how the game works. You will then be redirected to the main dashboard where the Bingo engine can be found.
From that screen, the game can be played.

### The login screen 
The login screen consists of a login box where a user name can be entered. If an incorrect user name is entered a button called Not You? can be pressed to refresh the page.
After entering the user name a password box will appear, if the correct password is entered you will then be redirected to the starting video.

## Bingo Engine

The bingo engine has multiple features including autoplay where the engine will generate a new number once a timer has elapsed, the speed of this timer can be set via a dropdown called game speed.
Once a number has been generated it is added to the called number board on the left-hand side of the screen. This is for reference when a caller shouts for a win.
Hitting the space bar at any time will pause the game and stop the auto number generation.
